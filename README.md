# ESPCS
Exal Serial Protocol Communication System for Arduino
ESPCS allows you to receive instructions in a simplified way on the serial port.

The messages follow the following logic:
5,8;
5 for "address 5" and 8 for "value of address 5".
the comma acts as a separator and the ";" as an end character.
